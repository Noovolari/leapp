Above is how the Start method is coded in AWS Session Service by means of a template.</p> <p>Using a template ensures that every Access Method for AWS, will need to implement only some specific parts of the code, without compromising the general logic.</p> <p>The steps included are:</p> <ul> <li>Stop all sessions with the same name profile - only one session can be activated with a specific profile name at a time.</li> <li>Put Session state to loadingInBrowser.</li> <li>Generate a set of new temporary credentials for the given session - this is overridden by the specific Access Method.</li> <li>Once obtained the new temporary credentials apply them - this step is also overridden by Access Methods.</li> <li>Finally set Session state to active using sessionActivate() method.

Rotate() is called by the Client every time a session is expired (temporary credentials are no longer valid). Calling Rotate will generate a new set of temporary credentials, replacing the old ones.</p> <p>The steps included are:</p> <ul> <li>Put Session state to loadingInBrowser.</li> <li>Generate a set of new temporary credentials for the given session - this is overridden by the specific Access Method.</li> <li>Once obtained the new temporary credentials apply them - this step is also overridden by Access Methods.</li> <li>Finally set Session state to active by calling the sessionRotated() method.

In this case, we de-apply temporary credentials, which in the case of AWS, means removing them from the credential file.</p> <p>Steps here are:</p> <ul> <li>De-apply credentials - this method is overridden by specific implementations of Access Methods, usually involving operations other than removing credentials from credentials file, like removing sensible information from your Secret Vault because they are no longer used.</li> <li>Deactivate the session - which involves putting the Session' state to inactive. The Session will be moved from active session list to general session list in the UI.</li> </ul> <p>As always in case of error, we send general error information to the UI and to the log file via sessionError.</p> <p>To conclude, each Access Method has a specific service that extends AwsSessionService implementing these 3 common methods (generate, apply, and de-apply).</p>","title":"AwsSessionService (Provider Service)"},{"location":"contributing/project-structure/#access-method-session-service","text":"<p>An Access Method generates credentials for the User access to a Cloud Provider, for example, in AWS we have different access methods:</p> <ul> <li>AWS IAM Users</li> <li>AWS IAM Roles Federated</li> <li>AWS IAM Role Chained</li> <li>AWS SSO Role.</li> </ul> <p>Each access method service implements actions to Create, Delete, and Edit this specific Session Type.</p> <p>As the first thing we need to create an interface of all the required information to a specific Access Method:</p> <pre><code>export interface AwsPlainSessionRequest {\n  accountName: string;\n  accessKey: string;\n  secretKey: string;\n  region: string;\n  mfaDevice?: string;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To set up a specific session from an Access Method we have to create it with a Create method, which uses the interface previously defined:</p> <pre><code>create(accountRequest: AwsPlainSessionRequest, profileId: string): void {\n    const session = new AwsPlainSession(accountRequest.accountName, accountRequest.region, profileId, accountRequest.mfaDevice);\n    this.keychainService.saveSecret(environment.appName, `${session.sessionId}-plain-aws-session-access-key-id`, accountRequest.accessKey);\n    this.keychainService.saveSecret(environment.appName, `${session.sessionId}-plain-aws-session-secret-access-key`, accountRequest.secretKey);\n    this.workspaceService.addSession(session);\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>At the moment edit and delete are defined generally in SessionService, so no need to implement them in an Access Method.</p> <p>To allow using other services to construct our logic we define them in the constructor of the service class.</p> <pre><code>constructor(\n    protected workspaceService: WorkspaceService,\n    private keychainService: KeychainService,\n    private appService: AppService,\n    private fileService: FileService) {\n    super(workspaceService);\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>We also need to define a super(workspaceService) as we are extending AwsSessionService, and thus its constructor.</p> <p>To fulfill its tasks an Access Method must extend AwsSessionService; doing so, will require to implement these three methods:</p> <pre><code>async generateCredentials(sessionId: string): Promise&lt;CredentialsInfo&gt; {}\n\nasync applyCredentials(sessionId: string, credentialsInfo: CredentialsInfo): Promise&lt;void&gt; {}\n\nasync deApplyCredentials(sessionId: string): Promise&lt;void&gt; {}\n</code></pre> <p>They are mandatory, but besides them, a Developer can add to the service class every private or static method he/she would like to organize the code.</p> <p>We present AWS IAM Users Access Method implementation as an example.</p>","title":"Access Method Session Service"},{"location":"contributing/project-structure/#aws-iam-users-access-method","text":"<p>Below we present all the methods implemented in the AWS IAM User Access Method; its purpose is to build temporary IAM STS credentials starting from a standard IAM User credential set.</p> <p>The Set is stored securely upon session creation in the OS Vault and is used at runtime, and only here to generate valid IAM STS temporary credentials.</p> <p>Let's start with two helper methods:</p> <pre><code>static isTokenExpired(tokenExpiration: string): boolean {\n    const now = Date.now();\n    return now &gt; new Date(tokenExpiration).getTime();\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>With isTokenExpired we check the SessionToken expiration given with the temporary credentials to see if they are still valid or not (thus the method returning a boolean).</p> <pre><code>static sessionTokenFromGetSessionTokenResponse(getSessionTokenResponse: GetSessionTokenResponse): { sessionToken: any } {\n    return {\n      sessionToken: {\n        // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/naming-convention\n        aws_access_key_id: getSessionTokenResponse.Credentials.AccessKeyId.trim(),\n        // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/naming-convention\n        aws_secret_access_key: getSessionTokenResponse.Credentials.SecretAccessKey.trim(),\n        // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/naming-convention\n        aws_session_token: getSessionTokenResponse.Credentials.SessionToken.trim(),\n      }\n    };\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>The second helper method constructs a CredentialInfo object to return to the AWSSessionService template for Start() and Rotate().
