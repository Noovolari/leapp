![logo](.github/images/README-1.png)

Leapp is a Cross-Platform Cloud access App, built on top of [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).

The App is designed to **manage and secure Cloud Access in multi-account environments.**

# Key features

> We Strongly believe that access information to Cloud in `~/.aws` or `~/.azure` files are not safe, and **[we prefer to store that information in an encrypted file managed by the system.](https://docs.leapp.cloud/contributing/system_vault/)**
> Credentials will be hourly rotated and accessible in those files only when they are needed, so only when Leapp is active.


- **Switch Cloud Profile in a click**
  
- **[Secure](https://docs.leapp.cloud/contributing/system_vault/) repository for your access data**

- **Multiple Cloud-Access [strategies](https://docs.leapp.cloud/use-cases/intro/)**

- **[No long-lived](https://docs.leapp.cloud/concepts/) credentials**

- **Generate and use sessions directly from [your aws Organization](https://docs.leapp.cloud/use-cases/aws_sso/)**

- **Connect EC2 instances straight away**

All the covered access methods can be found [here](https://docs.leapp.cloud/use-cases/intro/).

<details>
<summary>Initial Dev Setup</summary>

This repository is structured as a monorepo and contains many Node.JS packages. Each package has
its own set of commands, but the most common commands are available from the
root [`package.json`](package.json) and can be accessed using the `npm run ...` command. Here
are the only three commands you should need to start developing on the app.

```bash
# Install and Link Dependencies
npm install


# Start App without Live Reload
npm run electron-dev
```

If Electron is failing building the native Library `Keytar` just run before `npm run electron-dev`:
```bash
# Clear Electron and Keytar conflicts
npm run rebuild-keytar
```
