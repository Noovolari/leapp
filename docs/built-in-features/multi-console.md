### How to use it

Once you've installed the extension on your browser, you need to enable the Multi-Console Extension on the Leapp Desktop App in order to use it.

Click on the top-right cog icon to access the settings, click on the **Multi-Console** tab and then click **Enable Multi-Console Extension**.

![enable option](../../images/built-in-features/enable-option.png?style=even-smaller-img)

From the contextual menu of a session (accessed by right-clicking on it), simply select **Open Web Console**. 

!!! info 
    
    If any communication error occurs, your browser is not open or you don't have the extension installed/enabled on it, the web console will be opened in your default
    browser without using the extension (and will be limited to a single session).

---

By clicking on the Leapp Multi-Console Extension icon in your browser, a list of all currently active sessions will be shown. 

This list contains information obtained from Leapp about the session, including **Session Name, Session Role and Session Region**.

![leapp browser ui](../../images/built-in-features/leapp-browser-ui.png?style=even-smaller-img)

In the extension interface, click on a row to select and **focus the tab in which you opened the related AWS Console**, so you can easily navigate among many AWS Consoles
at the same time.
