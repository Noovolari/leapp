You can **open the AWS Web Console directly from Leapp**, without having to log in, input your credentials, or select the role to assume.

To do that just *right-click* or *select* the session you want to open in the web console, and click on the <img src="../../images/built-in-features/opening.png" alt="" title=""> icon either in the **context-menu** or 

in the **bottom-bar** below.

Leapp will open your default browser with the Region and the Role already prepared for you in the account you've selected.

> **note:** to use this feature correctly, remember to logout from any web console already opened in the browser.

> **note:** the feature currently is available for IAM Role Federated Sessions, Single Sign-On Sessions, and IAM Role Chained Sessions.
