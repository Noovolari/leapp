## What is AWS Identity Center (ex AWS Single Sign-On)

AWS Identity Center (ex AWS Single Sign-On) is a cloud service that allows you to grant your users access to AWS resources across multiple AWS accounts.

AWS SSO provides a directory that you can use to create users, organize them in groups, and set permissions across those groups; alternatively, you can obtain them from your Microsoft Active Directory or any standards-based identity provider, such as Okta Universal Directory or Azure AD.

After logging in the first time, Leapp will map all your roles and users into Sessions.  

!!! Info

    To get started using AWS SSO refer to [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html){: target='_blank'}.

## Required information

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                    |

| `INTEGRATION TYPE` | Set as *AWS Single Sign-on*                                                                                                                                    |
