## What is an Azure integration

Our Leapp integration refers to Azure Tenant which is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD.

The tenant is automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription.

These subscriptions include Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. 

An Azure tenant represents a single organization and can have multiple subscriptions.

Please refer to [How to find your Azure Active Directory tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant){: target='_blank'} and other [Azure AD documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis){: target='_blank'} for more information.

!!! Warning

    For azure-cli users with version < 2.30.0: Leapp no longer supports this version of the CLI. Please update to a newer version.

To create a new Azure Integration, go to the left sidebar of Leapp Desktop and click on the :fontawesome-solid-circle-plus: icon. 
A new modal will be presented with the following option to compile. After submitting the new Integration 
and have logged into your *Azure Portal*, 
*Subscriptions* will be automatically retrieved and mapped into Leapp Azure Sessions.
