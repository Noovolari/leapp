## Touch ID

You can also use your fingerprint to unlock Leapp if your PC is Touch ID compatible. 
After Logging to your Pro workspace for the first time, Leapp will associate your workspace with your system Touch ID. 
After that the option will be available and can also be tweaked in the general tab of the option menu.
